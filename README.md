Angular JSON Resource
=====================

This is a simple AngularJS directive that allows you to add JSON resource to your source HTML file.
Uses of such include, but are not limited to:
* Pre-cache lookup variables that you do not need to pre-load.
* Prevents another HTTP call to your server.

More documentation is forthcoming.
